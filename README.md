# Web_Scraping_Mars Data

Build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. 
Images folder shows the successful scrape of the webscraping. It is not deployed in another environment and must be run locally to view in real time.
The data is scraped using Splinter and BeautifulSoup for mars featured image, title for the image, moons of mars, and mars data. All of the data is then displayed on a page using only bootstrap and HTML. All of the data is also pushed to a mongo database.
